# ADO.NET and Relational Databases

- Most of the applications so far have been short-lived
- Any information they need is either hardcoded or supplied by the user
- In the real world, many applications deal with large quantities of data,
  derived from somewhere else
- That data could be in a database, or a text document, or an XML file, or one
  of many other storage methods
- ADO.NET was designed to provide a disconnected data architecture
- Data is retrieved from a database and cached on the local machine
- Manipulate the data on the local computer and connect to the database only
  when it is needed to alter records or acquire new data
- There are significant advantages to disconnecting the data architecture from
  the database
- The biggest is that the application will create a reduced burden on the
  database server, which helps the application to scale well
- As the number of users increase, the burden is not greater
- Database connections are resource-intensive
- A disconnected architecture is resource-frugal
- ADO.NET typically connects to the database to retrieve data, and connects
  again to update data when changes have been made
- Most applications spend most of their time simply reading through data and
  displaying it
- ADO.NET provides a disconnected subset of the data for use while reading or
  displaying
- It is up to the developer to keep in mind that the data in the database may
  change while disconnected

## Relational Databases and SQL

- A database is a repository of data
- A relational database organizes data into tables
- The Northwind database is available as a free download from Microsoft
- It was originally intended for a much older version of SQL Server, but it
  works well for the examples without requiring any installation effort

## Using the Northwind Database

- The Northwind database is a database file that's intended for testing and
  practice purposes
- To use it, SQL Server (SQLExpress) service needs to be running

## Verify that SQLExpress is Accessible

- Now test to make sure a data connection can be made
- Select `View -> Other Windows -> Data Sources`
- Click `Add New Data Source...`
- `Select Database`, then `Next`
- `Select Dataset`, then `Next`
- Click `New Connection...`
- From the `Server` name drop down list, choose or type in `.\sqlexpress`
- Select `Northwind` from the select or enter a database name drop down list and
  click `Test Connection`
- Click `OK`, then `Next`, and `Next`
- Now choose your database objects
- Expand `Tables`
- Select which tables to add
- Choose either the entire table or
- Expand the table and choose specific fields
- Click `Finish`
- You will now have a dataset showing in the `Data Sources` window

## Tables, Records, and Columns

- The `Northwind` database describes a fictional company buying and selling food
  products
- The data for `Northwind` is divided into 13 tables, or broad sets of data,
  including `Customers`, `Employees`, `Orders`,

## Order Details, Products, etc

- Every table in a relational database is organized into rows, where each row
  represents a single record
- The rows are organized into columns, which represent categories of data
- All of the rows in a table have the same column structure
- For example, the `Orders` table has `OrderID`, `CustomerID`, `EmployeeID`,
  `OrderDate`, etc.
- For any given order, the customer's name, address, contact name, etc. needs to
  be known
- That information could be stored with each order, but that would be very
  inefficient
- Instead, use a second table called `Customers`, in which each row represents a
  single customer
- In the `Customers` table is a column for the `CustomerID`
- Every customer has a unique ID, and that field is marked as the primary key
  for that table
- A primary key is the column or combination of columns that uniquely identified
  a record in a given table
- The `Orders` table uses the `CustomerID` as a foreign key
- A foreign key is a column that is a primary key from a different table
- The Orders table uses the `CustomerID` (primary key in the `Customers` table)
  to identify which customer has placed the order
- To determine the address for the order, use the `CustomerID` to look up the
  customer record in the `Customers` table
- This use of foreign keys is particularly helpful in representing one-to-many
  or many-to-one relationships among tables
- By separating information into tables that are linked by foreign keys, it
  avoids having to repeat information in records
- A single customer, for example, can have multiple orders, but it is
  inefficient to place the same customer information in every order record
- The process of removing redundant information from records and shifting it to
  separate tables is called normalization

## Normalization

- Normalization not only makes the use of the database more efficient, but it
  also reduces the likelihood of data corruption
- Keeping the customer's name in both the `Customers` table and the `Orders`
  table runs the risk that a change in one table might not be reflected in the
  other
- SQL Server avoids data corruption bugs by enforcing constraints that can be
  defined
- For example, the `Customers` table marks the `CustomerID` as the primary key
- This creates a primary key constraint in the database, ensuring that each
  `CustomerID` is unique

## Declarative Referential Integrity

- Relational database use declarative referential integrity (DRI) to establish
  constraints on the relationships among the various tables
- For example, declaring a constraint on the Orders table that dictates that no
  order can have a `CustomerID` unless that `CustomerID` represents a valid
  record in `Customers`
- This helps avoid two types of mistakes:
  - Can't enter a record with an invalid `CustomerID`
  - Can't delete a customer record if that `CustomerID` is used in any order
- The integrity of data and its relationships is protected

## SQL

- The most popular language for querying and manipulating databases is
  Structured query Language
- SQL is a declarative language as opposed to a procedural language
- The heart of SQL is the query
- A query is a statement that returns a set of records from the database
- For example, see all the `CompanyName`s and `CustomerID`s of every record in
  the `Customers` table in which the customer's address is in London

```sql
select CustomerID, CompanyName
from Customers
where city = 'London';
```

## Output

```console
CustomerID  CompanyName
----------  ---------------------
AROUT       Around the Horn
BSBEV       B's Beverages
CONSH       Consolidated Holdings
EASTC       Eastern Connection
NORTS       North/South
SEVES       Seven Seas Imports
```

- This can also be sorted based on a field:

```sql
select CustomerID, CompanyName
from Customers
where city = 'London'
order by CompanyName;
```

- SQL is capable of much more powerful queries:
- Suppose the Northwind manager would like to know what products were purchased
  in July 1996 by the customer "Vins et alcools Chevalier"
- This is somewhat more complicated
- The `Order Details` table knows the `ProductID` for all products in any given
  order
- The `Orders` table knows which `CustomerID`s are associated with an order
- The `Customers` table knows the `CustomerID` for a customer
- The `Products` table knows the product name for the `ProductID`
- Here's the query to tie this all together:

```sql
select o.OrderID, productName
from [Order Details] od
join orders o on o.OrderID = od.OrderID
join products p on p.ProductID = od.ProductID
join customers c on o.CustomerID = c.CustomerID
where c.CompanyName = 'Vins et alcools Chevalier'
    and orderDate >= '7/1/1996'
    and orderDate < '8/1/1996';
```

- This asks the database to get the `OrderID` and the product name from the
  relevant tables
- The line from `[Order Details]` or creates an alias for the `Order Details`
  table
- The rest of the statement says that the database should look at od, and then
  join that with the `Orders` table (aliased to `o`) for every record in which
  the `OrderID` in the `Order Details` table (`od.OrderID`) is the same as the
  `OrderID` in the `Orders` table (`o.OrderID`)
- When two tables are joined:
- "Get every matching record that exists in either table" is called an outer
  join
- "Get only those matching records that exist in both tables" is called an inner
  join
- An inner join states to get only the records in Orders that match the records
  in `Order Details` by having the same value in the `OrderID` field
  (`on o.OrderID = od.OrderID`)
- SQL joins are inner joins by default
- The SQL statement then goes on to ask the database to create an inner join
  with `Products` (aliased to `p`), getting every row in which the `ProductID`
  in the `Products` table is the same as the `ProductID` in the Order `Details`
  table
- Then, create an inner join with customers for those rows where the
  `CustomerID` is the same in both the `Orders` table and the `Customers` table
- Finally, tell the database to constrain the results to only those rows in
  which the `CompanyName` is the desired one, and the dates are in July
- The collection of constraints finds only three records that match:

## Output

```console
OrderID ProductName
------- -----------------------------
10248   Queso Cabrales
10248   Singaporean Hokkien Fried Mee
10248   Mozzarella di Giovanni
```

- This output shows that there was only one order (10248) in which the customer
  had the right `ID` and in which the date of the order was July 1996
- That order produced three records in the `Order Details` table, and using the
  `ProductID`s in these three records, the product names were retrieved from the
  `Products` table
- SQL can be used not only for searching and retrieving data, but also for
  creating, updating, and deleting tables, and generally for managing and
  manipulating both the content and the structure of the database

## The ADO.NET Object Model

- The ADO.NET object model is rich, but at its heart it is a fairly
  straight-forward set of classes
- The most important of these is the `DataSet`
- The `DataSet` represents a subset of the entire database, cached on the local
  machine without a continuous connection to the database
- Periodically, the `DataSet` will reconnect to its parent database, update the
  database with changes made to the `DataSet`, and update the `DataSet` with
  changes in the database made by other users or processes
- This is highly efficient, but to be effective, the `DataSet` must be a robust
  subset of the database, capturing not just a few rows from a single table, but
  also a set of tables with all the metadata necessary to represent the
  relationships and constraints of the original database
- The `DataSet` is composed of `DataTable` objects as well as `DataRelation`
  objects
- These are accessed as properties of the `DataSet` object
- The `Tables` property returns a `DataTableCollection`, which in turn contains
  all the `DataTable` objects

## DataTables and DataColumns

- A `DataTable` can be created programmatically or as a result of a query
  against the database
- The `DataTable` has a number of public properties, including the `Columns`
  collection, which returns the `DataColumnCollection` object, which in turn
  consists of `DataColumn` objects
- Each `DataColumn` object represents a column in a table

## DataRelations

- In addition to the Tables collection, the `DataSet` has a `Relations`
  property, which returns a `DataRelationCollection` consisting of
  `DataRelation` objects
- Each `DataRelation` represents a relationship between two tables through
  `DataColumn` objects
- For example, in the `Northwind` database, the `Customers` table is in a
  relationship with the `Orders` table through the `CustomerID` column
- The nature of this relationship is one-to-many
- For any given order, there is exactly one customer, but any given customer
  might be represented in any number of orders

## Rows

- The `Rows` collection of the `DataTable` returns a set of rows for that table
- Use this collection to examine the results of queries against the database,
  iterating through the rows to examine each record in turn, typically with a
  foreach loop

## DataAdapter

- The `DataSet` is an abstraction of a relational database
- ADO.NET uses a DataAdapter as a bridge between the `DataSet` and the data
  source, which is the underlying database
- `DataAdapter` provides the `Fill()` method to retrieve data from the database
  and populate the `DataSet`
- Instead of tying the `DataSet` object too closely to the database
  architecture, ADO.NET uses a `DataAdapter` object to mediate between the
  `DataSet` object and the database
- This decouples the `DataSet` from the database and allows a single `DataSet`
  to represent more than one database or other data source

## DbCommand and DbConnection

- The `DbConnection` object represents a connection to a data source
- This connection can be shared among different command objects
- The `DbCommand` object allows a command to be sent (SQL statement) to the
  database
- Often, these objects are implicitly created when a `DataAdapter` is created,
  but these objects can be explicitly accessed
- Declare a connection string as:

```cs
string connectionString =
    @"server=.\sqlexpress; Trusted_Connection=yes; database=Northwind";
```

- Use this connection string to create a connection object or to create a
  `DataAdapter` object

## DataReader

- An alternative to creating a `DataSet` (and a `DataAdapter`) is to create a
  `DataReader`
- The `DataReader` provides connected, forward-only, readonly access to a
  collection of tables by executing either a SQL statement or store procedures
- `DataReaders` are lightweight objects that are ideally suited for filling
  controls with data and then breaking the connection to the backend database

## Getting Started with ADO.NET

- Create a console application and list out bits of information from the
  `Customers` table in `Northwind`
- Add the following two lines:

```cs
using System.Data;
using System.Data.SqlClient;
```

- The first thing needed is a way to identify the location of the SQL Server
  instance to the program
- This is commonly called the connection string
- Once created, the same string can be used anytime

```cs
string connectionString =
    @"server=.\sqlexpress; Trusted_Connection=yes; database=Northwind";
```

- The next thing needed is a string to hold the SQL command itself
- SQL Server can't understand C# directly, so the entries in the database can't
  be treated as though they were C# objects
- This is called the command string
- Want to retrieve (`Select`) the company name and the contact name columns from
  the `Customers` table

```cs
string commandString = "Select CompanyName, ContactName from Customers";
```

- Now what's needed is to contact the database using a `DataAdapter` object
- There are different kinds of `DataAdapter` objects, each for a different kind
  of database
- In this case, a SQL Server database needs a `SqlDataAdapter` object
- The constructor takes two parameters, the command string and the connection
  string

```cs
SqlDataAdapter myDataAdapter = new SqlDataAdapter(commandString, connectionString);
```

- Now what's needed is a `DataSet` object before anything can be done with the
  data

```cs
DataSet myDataSet = new DataSet();
```

- Then call the `Fill()` method of `myDataAdapter`, passing in the new `DataSet`
- This fills the `DataSet` with the data obtained from the SQL statement

```cs
myDataAdapter.Fill(myDataSet);
```

- Now the data can be queried, manipulated, and otherwise managed
- To display the data, a `DataTable` object will be needed
- The `DataSet` object has a collection of tables, but the `select` statement
  retrieved only a single table, so only the first one needs to be accessed:

```cs
DataTable myDataTable = myDataSet.Tables[0];
```

- Each `DataTable` contains a set of `DataRow` objects, and each of those rows
  contains keys for each data field in the row
- The two column names in the table are `CompanyName` and `ContactName`, so
  their values can be accessed using a foreach loop:

```cs
foreach (DataRow dataRow in myDataTable.Rows) {
    Console.WriteLine($"CompanyName: {dataRow["CompanyName"]}, Contact: {dataRow["ContactName"]}");
}
```

- Putting it all together:

```cs
// create the data connection
string connectionString = @"server=.\sqlexpress;Trusted_Connection=yes;database=Northwind";

// create the string to hold the SQL command to get records from the Customers table
string commandString = "Select CompanyName, ContactName from Customers";

// create the data adapter with the connection string and command
SqlDataAdapter myDataAdapter = new SqlDataAdapter(commandString, connectionString);

// Create and fill the DataSet object
DataSet myDataSet = new DataSet(); myDataAdapter.Fill(myDataSet);

// Retrieve the Customers table
DataTable myDataTable = myDataSet.Tables[0];

// iterate over the rows collection and output the fields
foreach (DataRow dataRow in myDataTable.Rows) {
    Console.WriteLine("CompanyName: { dataRow["CompanyName"] }, Contact: { dataRow["ContactName"] }");
}
```
