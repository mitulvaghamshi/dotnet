## Authentication vs. Authorization

- Authentication is a process in which a user provides credentials that are then
  compared to those previously stored in an operating system, database, app or
  resource
- If they match, the user authenticates successfully
- Once authenticated a user can then perform actions that they're authorized for
- The authorization refers to the process that determines what a user is allowed
  to do

## Encryption vs. Hashing

- Sensitive data (like passwords) should never be stored in clear text in a
  database
- Two approaches: **Encryption** or **Hashing**
- An **encrypted** value can be **decrypted** back into it’s original clear text
  value
- **Hashing** is a one way process, a hash value can not be reconstituted back
  into it’s original clear text value
- **Encryption** is not secure for long term storage
- It is secure for short term situations (HTTPS sessions)
- **Hashing** (with **salt**) is more secure and is used by ASP.NET Core
  **Identity**

  - Enter a key (random string for scrambling and unscrambling data)
  - Encrypt some short text
  - Encrypt some longer text, notice the difference
  - Encrypt password, then decrypt it
- [https://codebeautify.org/sha256-hash-generator](https://codebeautify.org/sha256-hash-generator)
  - Hash some short text
  - Hash some longer text, notice the output is same length
  - Hash using the **sha512** algorithm, notice output is longer

## ASP.NET Core Identity

- ASP.NET Core **Identity** is a membership system that adds login functionality
  to ASP.NET Core apps
- Users can create an account with the login information stored in **Identity**
  or they can use an **external** login provider
- Supported external login providers include **Facebook**, **Google**,
  **Microsoft** Account and **Twitter**
- **Identity** can be configured using a **SQL Server** database (or any other
  database) to store user names, passwords, and profile data
- Alternatively, another persistent store can be used, for example, **Azure
  Table Storage**

## General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)

- In 2018, the _European Union_ introduced the GDPR
- ASP.NET Core **Identity** is compliant with GDPR
- One of the stipulations of GDPR is that users can manage the information that
  an enterprise holds about them

## Authorization

- Once authenticated, authorization can be handled
- A `method` or a `class` can be **decorated** with the `[Authorize]` or
  `[AllowAnonymous]` attributes
- If a `method` is **decorated** with `[Authorize]`, the user must be
  authenticated to access it
- If a `class` is **decorated** with `[Authorize]`, all **methods** require
  authentication, unless decorated with `[AllowAnonymous]`

## ASP.NET Core Identity

- When ASP.NET Core **Identity** is added to a project, it is added as a _Razor
  Class Library_ (RCL)
- A _Razor Class Library_ contains `Razor views`, `pages`, `controllers`,
  `page models`, `Razor components`, `View components` and `data models`

## Customizing ASP.NET Core Identity

- ASP.NET Core **Identity** has many points of customization
- `IdentityOptions` allows configuring password, lockout, user options and more
- In order to customize one of the provided endpoints, the identity scaffolder
  must be used to generate the appropriate code

## Select Identity RCL Endpoints

- /Identity/Account/Logout
- /Identity/Account/Manage
- /Identity/Account/Register
