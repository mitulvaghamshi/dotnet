## Status Code Pages

- By default, an ASP.NET Core app doesn't provide a status code page for HTTP
  error status codes, such as `404 - Not Found`
- When the app encounters an `HTTP 400-599` error status code that doesn't have
  a body, it returns the status code and an empty response body
- To provide status code pages, use the status code pages middleware

## _ViewStart.cshtml

- Code that needs to run before each view or page should be placed in the
  `_ViewStart.cshtml` file
- By convention, this file is located in the `Views` folder
- The statements listed are run before every full view

## _ViewImports.cshtml

- `Views` and `Pages` can use `Razor` directives to import namespaces and use
  dependency injection
- Directives shared by many views may be specified in a common
  `_ViewImports.cshtml` file

## Hierarchy

- `_ViewImports.cshtml`, `_ViewStart.cshtml` are both hierarchical
- If a `_ViewStart.cshtml` (or `_ViewImports.cshtml`) file is defined in a view
  or folder, it will be run after the one defined in the root of the `Views`
  folder

## Custom Validation

- Recall the list of
  [possible annotations](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.componentmodel.dataannotations?view=net-5.0)
- To be consistent with the DRY (Donâ€™t Repeat Yourself) principle, validations
  should be specified in the `Model`
- The custom validation class inherits from `ValidationAttribute` and overrides
  the `IsValid` method
