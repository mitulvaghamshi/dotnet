## Blazor Wasm Project Structure

- `Program.cs` calls `WebAssemblyHostBuilder` which sets the default page to
  `index.html`; it also specifies to use `App.razor` as the **root** component
- `Startup.cs` doesâ€™t exist
- `wwwroot/index.html`, `App.razor`, `Shared/MainLayout.razor`, `NavMenu.razor`
  all work together to setup the overall page structure

## Binding

- We have been using **one-way** binding with the `@` symbol and a variable name
- For example, in the `Counter.razor` component, `@currentCount` is used to
  display the output
- **Two-Way** binding allows the reading of values

## ASP.NET Core Hosted

- When creating a Blazor **Wasm** app, the opportunity to select ASP.NET Core
  hosted is presented
- When this option is chosen, 3 folders are created in the solution
  - Client
  - Server
  - Shared
- The `Client` folder contains the Blazor **Wasm** project, which will be the
  same as a **regular** Blazor **Wasm** project
- In the Solution Explorer, this will be named `ProjectName.Client`
- The `Server` folder contains a Web API project which will be the same as
  **regular** Web API project
- In the Solution Explorer, this will be named `ProjectName.Server`
- This part of the project will run server-side and have access to all of the
  resources normally available
- The `Startup` class points to the client's `index.html` page
- The `Shared` folder is where any files are placed that are needed by both the
  `Client` and the `Server` projects
- In the Solution Explorer, this will be named `ProjectName.Shared`

## Progressive Web Application

- **PWAs** are web apps that are installable on _Desktop_ and _Phone_ OSs
- They can potentially work offline
- They make use of service workers and manifests
- Service workers act as proxy servers that sit between web applications, the
  browser, and the network (when available)
- A manifest is a `JSON` file that provides information about how a web app
  would be downloaded and be presented to the user similarly to a native app

## Blazor PWA Project Structure

- Nearly identical to **regular** Blazor **Wasm**
- The `wwwroot` folder will contain additional files
- `icon-512.png`
- `manifest.json`
- `service-worker.js`
- `index.html` will contain references to the _manifest_, _icon_ and
  _service-worker_ files
