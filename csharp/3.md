## LINQ

- A List is similar to an array but provides additional functionality, such as
  dynamic resizing.
- A language called SQL is the international standard used to perform
  queries(i.e., to request information that satisfies given criteria) and to
  manipulate data.
- C#'s LINQ (_Language-Integrated Query_) capabilities allow you to write query
  expressionsthat retrieve information from a variety of data sources, not just
  databases.
- LINQ to Objects can be used to filter arrays and Lists, selecting elements
  that satisfy a set of conditions
- A LINQ provider is a set of classes that implement LINQ operations and enable
  programs to interact with data sources to perform tasks such as projecting,
  sorting, grouping and filtering elements.
- There are two LINQ approaches:
  - One uses a SQL-like syntax
  - The other uses method-call syntax

## Querying an Array of int Values Using LINQ

- Iteration statements that filter arrays focus on the steps required to get the
  results.
- This is called imperative programming.
- LINQ queries specify the conditions that selected elements must satisfy
- This is known as declarative programming.
- The `System.Linq` namespace contains the LINQ to Objects provider.

## The `from` Clause

- A LINQ query begins with a `from` clause, which specifies a range variable
  (`value`) and the data source to query (`values`).
- The range variable represents each item in the data source, much like the
  control variable in a `foreach` statement.

## The `where` Clause

- If the condition in the `where` clause evaluates to `true`, the element is
  selected.
- A predicate is an expression that takes an element of a collection and returns
  `true` or `false` by testing a condition on that element.

## The `select` Clause

- The `select` clause determines what value appears in the results.

## The `orderby` Clause

- The `orderby` clause sorts the query results in ascending order.
- The descending modifier in the `orderby` clause sorts the results in
  descending order.
- Any value that can be compared with other values of the same type may be used
  with the `orderby` clause.

## The `let` Clause

- LINQ's `let` clause can be used to create a new range variable to store a
  temporary result for use later in the LINQ query.

## Interface `IEnumerable<T>`

- The `IEnumerable<T>` interface describes the functionality of any object that
  can be iterated over and thus offers members to access each element.
- Arrays and collections already implement the `IEnumerable<T>` interface.
- A LINQ query returns an object that implements the `IEnumerable<T>` interface.
- With LINQ, the code that selects elements and the code that displays them are
  kept separate, making the code easier to understand and maintain.

## Querying an Array Using LINQ

- LINQ is not limited to querying arrays of simple types such as integers.
- It cannot be used when a query does not have a defined meaning for example,
  you cannot use `orderby` on objects values that are not comparable.
- Comparable types in .NET are those that implement the `IComparable<T>`.
- All built-in types, such as `string`, `int` and `double` implement
  `IComparable<T>`.

## Accessing the Properties of a LINQ Query's Range Variable

- A `where` clause can access the properties of the range variable.
- The conditional `AND` (`&&`) operator can be used to combine conditions.

## Sorting a LINQ Query's Results by Multiple Properties

- An `orderby` clause can sort the results according to multiple properties,
  specified in a comma-separated list.

## `Any`, `First` and `Count` Extension Methods

- The query result's `Any` method returns `true` if there is at least one
  element, and `false` if there are no elements.
- The query result's `First` method returns the first element in the result.
- The `Count` method of the query result returns the number of elements in the
  results.

## Selecting a Property of an Object

- The `select` clause can be used to select a member of the range variable
  rather than the range variable itself.
- The `Distinct` method removes duplicate elements, causing all elements in the
  result to be unique.

## Creating New Types in the `select` Clause of a LINQ Query

- The `select` clause can create a new object of `anonymous` type (a type with
  no name), which the compiler generates for you based on the properties listed
  in the curly braces (`{}`).
  ```cs
  new {e.FirstName, e.LastName}
  ```
- By default, the name of the property being selected is used as the property's
  name in the result.
- You can specify a different name for the property inside the `anonymous` type
  definition
- Implicitly typed local variables allow you to use `anonymous` types because
  you do not have to explicitly state the type when declaring such variables.
- When the compiler creates an `anonymous` type, it automatically generates a
  `ToString` method that returns a string representation of the object.
- Creating an `anonymous` type in a LINQ quere is an example of a projection it
  performs a transformation on the data.
- The transformation creates new objects containing only the specified
  properties
- Such transformations can also manipulate the data.

## Deferred Execution

- LINQ uses deferred execution, the query executes only when you access the
  results, not when you define the query.
- Deferred execution can improve performance when a query's results are not
  immediately needed.

## Extension Methods `ToArray` and `ToList`

- LINQ extension methods `ToArray` and `ToList` immediately execute the query on
  which they are called.
- These methods execute the query only once, improving efficiency.
- Methods `ToArray` and `ToList` also can improve eff-ciency if you'll be
  iterating over the same results multiple times, as you execute the query only
  once.

## Functional Programming with LINQ/PLINQ

- Although SQL is a powerful tool for retrieving and filtering information from
  a database, SQL commands don't integrate well with C#
- The `DataAdapter` and `DataSet` objects need to be bridged to connect the
  database query with the application
- The Language Integrated Query (LINQ) is the solution to that problem
- LINQ is a new feature of .NET that C# can take advantage of to make it easier
  to work with data
- Another useful feature of LINQ is to be able to address a number of different
  data sources using similar syntax
- LINQ can be used with SQL, but it doesn't have to be with a traditional
  database
- It can retrieve data from XML files and other data sources as well
- It can also query collections that are held in memory, such as collection
  classes within the application code
- For example, in a collection of Book objects, LINQ could query for all the
  books by a single author, or published after a certain date

## Querying In-Memory Data

- C# allows classes to be created that are complex, with many different
  properties, which sometimes are objects of other classes as well
- Collections of objects can be created that can be manipulated in different
  ways, but sometimes that complexity can work against the programmer
- For example, assume there is a class that represents shipping orders for a
  warehouse
- A ton of data could be kept in such an object, making it very versatile, but
  perhaps all that's needed is to just extract a list of zip codes of where all
  the customers live
- Code could be written easily enough to go through the entire collection of
  objects to pull out the zip code data, but it might be time consuming to write
- If the information were in a database, it would be easy to issue a SQL query,
  but collections can't be queried like a database
- Using LINQ, however, a SQL-like query can be issued against a collection in
  code to get another collection containing just the desired data
- Assume a simple `Book` class:

```cs
public class Book {
    public string Title { get; set; }
    public string Author { get; set; }
    public string Publisher { get; set; }
    public int PublicationYear { get; set; }
}
```

- Then, define a generic `List<Book>`, and fill it with a handful of `Book`
  objects:

```cs
List<Book> bookList = new List<Book> {
    new Book {
        Title = "Learning C# 3.0", Author = "Jesse Liberty",
        Publisher = "O'Reilly", PublicationYear = 2008
    },
    new Book {
        Title = "Programming C# 3.0", Author = "Jesse Liberty",
        Publisher = "O'Reilly", PublicationYear = 2008
    },
    new Book {
        Title = "C# 3.0 Cookbook", Author = "Jay Hilyard",
        Publisher = "O'Reilly", PublicationYear = 2007
    },
    new Book {
        Title = "C# 3.0 in a Nutshell", Author = "Ben Albahari",
        Publisher = "O'Reilly", PublicationYear = 2007
    },
};
```

- Now a query would need to be issued
- Find all books authored by Jesse Liberty:

```cs
IEnumerable<Book> resultsAuthor =
    from testBook in bookList
    where testBook.Author == "Jesse Liberty"
    select testBook;
```

- This query returns an enumerable collection of `Book` objects or, it can be
  said that it returns an instance of `IEnumerable<Book>`
- A LINQ data source must implement `IEnumerable`, and the result of the query
  must as well
- The rest of the query resembles a SQL query:
- A range variable, in this case `testBook`, is used in the same way as an
  iteration variable in a `foreach` loop
- Because the query is operating on `bookList`, which was previously defined as
  a `List<Book>`, the compiler automatically defines `testBook` as a `Book` type
- As with the SQL query, the from clause defines the range variable, and the in
  clause identifies the source
- The where clause is used to filter the data
- The select clause returns the results of the query as an enumerable collection
- This is called projection in database terminology
- In this example, the entire `Book` object was returned, but just some of the
  fields could be returned instead: `select testBook.Title;`
- Now with a collection of `Book` objects, use a `foreach` loop to process them,
  such as outputting them to the console:

```cs
foreach (Book testBook in resultsAuthor) {
    Console.WriteLine("{0}, by {1}", testBook.Title, testBook.Author);
}
```

- Any legal `Boolean` expression can be used in the where clause, such as all
  books published before 2008:

```cs
IEnumerable<Book> resultsDate =
    from testBook in bookList
    where testBook.PublicationYear < 2008
    select testBook;
```

## Output

```console
Books by Jesse Liberty:
    Learning C# 3.0, by Jesse Liberty
    Programming C# 3.0, by Jesse Liberty
    Programming C#, fourth edition, by Jesse Liberty
Books published before 2008:
    C# 3.0 Cookbook, by Jay Hilyard, 2007
    C# 3.0 in a Nutshell, by Ben Albahari, 2007
    Head First C#, by Andrew Stellman, 2007
    Programming C#, fourth edition, by Jesse Liberty, 2005
```

- It might be expected that the data would be retrieved from the data source
  when the `IEnumerable<T>` instance to hold the results is created
- In fact, the data isn't retrieved until something is done with the data in the
  `IEnumerable<T>`, such as outputting the contents in the foreach statement
- This behaviour is helpful because databases with many connections may be
  changing all the time
- LINQ doesn't retrieve the data until the last possible moment, right before
  it's going to be used

## Anonymous Types and Implicitly Typed Variables

- When the information from the collection is retrieved, the entire `Book`
  object is retrieved, but only the title and the author are used
- That's wasteful because more information is being retrieved than actually
  needed
- It would be preferable to be able to say:

```cs
IEnumerable<Book> resultsAuthor =
    from testBook in bookList
    where testBook.Author == "Jesse Liberty"
    select testBook.Title, testBook.Author;
```

- But this will cause an error, because the query can only return one type of
  object
- A new class could be defined, one which would hold just the two bits of
  information, but that would be wasteful as well
- It would get used in only one spot of the program, right before the data is
  retrieved and outputted
- Instead, a new class can be written on the fly:

```cs
IEnumerable<Book> resultsAuthor =
    from testBook in bookList
    where testBook.Author == "Jesse Liberty"
    select new {
        testBook.Title,
        testBook.Author
    };
```

- The class doesn't have a name and it doesn't really need one because it's only
  being used in this one spot
- Therefore this feature is called an anonymous type
- Based on the select statement, the compiler determines the number and types of
  the properties for the class and creates the class accordingly
- This code won't work yet though
- It's assigning the results of the query (now a collection of anonymous
  objects) to a collection of type `<Book>`
- That's a type mismatch, so the type will need to be changed
- But if the name of the anonymous type isn't known, what type does it get
  changed to?
- That's where implicitly typed variables come in
- C# has the ability to infer the type of a variable based on the value being
  assigned to it
- Even though the name of the anonymous type is not known, the compiler has
  assigned it an identifier, and can recognize that type when it's used
- Therefore the new query looks like this:

```cs
var resultsAuthor =
    from testBook in bookList
    where testBook.Author == "Jesse Liberty"
    select new {
        testBook.Title,
        testBook.Author
    };
```

- Now `resultsAuthor` is a collection of anonymous objects, and the compiler is
  perfectly fine with that
- All that's needed to know is that `resultsAuthor` is a collection that
  implements `IEnumerable` and that can be used to output the results:

```cs
foreach (var testBook in resultsAuthor) {
    Console.WriteLine("{0}, by {1}", testBook.Title, testBook.Author);
}
```

- The `Book` type has been replaced in the `foreach` loop with var, but the
  compiler still knows what type `testBook` is, because it's a member of the
  collection `resultsAuthor`, and the compiler knows what type that is, even if
  the programmer doesn't

## Lambda Expressions

- Back with delegates, it was mentioned that lambda expressions were created for
  use with LINQ, to create expressions that return a method instead of a single
  return value
- The same query could be written using lambda expressions:

```cs
var resultsAuthor = bookList.Where(bookEval => bookEval.Author == "Jesse Liberty");
```

- The keyword var lets the compiler infer that `resultsAuthor` is an
  `IEnumerable` collection
- "fill the `IEnumerable` collection `resultsAuthor` from the collection
  `bookList` with each member such that the `Author` property is equal to the
  string ‘Jesse Liberty'"
- The variable `bookEval` isn't declared anywhere
- It can be any valid name
- The `Boolean` expression on the right-hand side is projected onto the
  variable, which is passed to the `Where` method to use to evaluate the
  collection
- This method syntax takes some getting used to, and it can be easier to use the
  LINQ's query syntax

## Ordering and Joining

- In LINQ, the results of queries can also be ordered
- Two different tables can be joined in a query as well
- For example, to retrieve the `Book` objects in the collection, ordered by
  author name, use this query:

```cs
var resultList =
    from myBook in bookList
    orderby myBook.Author
    select myBook;

// or as a lambda expression
var resultList = bookList.OrderBy(bookEval => bookEval.Author);
```

## Output

```console
Books by author:
    Head First C#, by Andrew Stellman
    C# 3.0 in a Nutshell, by Ben Albahari
    C# 3.0 Cookbook, by Jay Hilyard
    Learning C# 3.0, by Jesse Liberty
    Programming C# 3.0, by Jesse Liberty
    Programming C#, fourth edition, by Jesse Liberty
```

- When joining two tables in SQL, fields are retrieved from two or more tables
  based on their common columns (foreign keys)
- To do the same for in-memory collections, join two separate collections
- Here's a class that represents a book purchase order:

```cs
public class PurchaseOrder {
    public int OrderNumber { get; set; }
    public string Title { get; set; }
    public int Quantity { get; set; }
}
```

- Here's a partial List collection of these objects:

```cs
List<PurchaseOrder> orderList = new List<PurchaseOrder> {
    new PurchaseOrder {
        OrderNumber = 23483,
        Title = "C# 3.0 Cookbook",
        Quantity = 57
    },
```

- To return the title, author, and quantity for a particular book or books, the
  information from the two collections would need to be joined
- The Title property is the common field
- It's the primary key in the `bookList` collection
- It's the foreign key in the `orderList` collection
- The query would be:

```cs
var resultList =
    from myBook in bookList
    join myOrder in orderList
    on myBook.Title equals myOrder.Title
    where myOrder.Quantity >= 50
    select new {
        myBook.Title,
        myBook.Author,
        myOrder.Quantity
    };
```

- The `from` and `select` clauses aren't any different from what's been seen
  before
- Defining an anonymous type here to hold the data wanted
- The join clause is a bit different though
- Joining the `bookList` collection with the `orderList` collection to create a
  new data set to search on
- The first part of the join just looks like a from, specifying the second
  collection to use:

```cs
join myOrder in orderList
```

- Have to specify some way to correlate the information in the two collections
- How to tell which orders go with which book record?
- They have the same `Title` property in common
- If the `Title` property of the book is the same as the `Title` property of the
  order, that's a match
- The on part of the `join` clause indicates the definition of the condition:

```cs
join myOrder in orderList on myBook.Title equals myOrder.Title
```

- Note that the keyword equals is used to define the `join` condition rather
  than the `==` operator
- The `where` clause specifies that records of orders with more than 50 copies
  sold are wanted

## Output

```console
Book orders with quantities greater than 50:
    Title: Programming C# 3.0
    Author: Jesse Liberty Quantity: 99

    Title: C# 3.0 Cookbook
    Author: Jay Hilyard Quantity: 57

    Title: C# 3.0 Cookbook
    Author: Jay Hilyard Quantity: 122
```

- Using a lambda expression, the equivalent query would be:

```cs
var resultList = bookList.Join(
    orderList,
    book => book.Title,
    order => order.Title,
    (book, order) => new {
        book.Title,
        book.Author,
        order.Quantity
    }).Where(order => order.Quantity >= 50);
```

## Using LINQ with SQL

- Although using SQL-like syntax with in-memory collections is possible, it's
  natural to use the SQL-like syntax with SQL databases
- With LINQ, instead of using the `DataAdapter` and `DataSet` classes, tables in
  a SQL database can be treated as classes
- The data can be worked with directly, as though the tables were objects
  created in code
- Create a new console application
- To use the LINQ data features, add a reference to the namespace
  `System.Data.Linq`
- Right click on the References folder of the project in the Solution Explorer
  and choose Add Reference
- A reference needs to be added to the `System.Data.Linq` namespace before LINQ
  can be used with a SQL database
- With the reference, the appropriate using statements will need to be added to
  take advantage of it:

```cs
using System.Data;
using System.Data.Linq;
using System.Data.Linq.Mapping;
```

- When using LINQ and SQL, database tables can be treated as classes, and the
  columns as members
- To retrieve some information from the `Northwind` database, create the
  following class:

```cs
[Table(Name = "Employees")]
public class Employee {
    [Column] public int EmployeeID { get; set; }
    [Column] public string FirstName { get; set; }
    [Column] public string LastName { get; set; }
}
```

- The extra code in square brackets are called attributes
- They provide extra modifiers to classes
- The `Table` attribute indicates that this class is drawn from a table, (the
  `Employees` table in the associated database)
- Each of the public properties in the class has a `Column` attribute to
  indicate that the property is associated with a column in the table
- A data context is always needed when working with a database
- In LINQ, creating the data context is much easier:

```cs
DataContext db = new DataContext(
    @"Data Source=.\SQLExpress;Initial Catalog=Northwind;Integrated Security=True"
);
```

- The `DataContext` object's constructor takes a string as its parameter, the
  same connection string used to connect to a database as previously used
- The `DataContext` object has an important method, `GetTable()`, which is how
  the data table is retrieved from the database and assigned to a generic
  `Table` collection
- The Table collection holds the type of objects that were defined earlier in
  the application

```cs
Table<Employee> employees = db.GetTable<Employee>();
```

- This is all that's needed to retrieve the data
- A query is still needed
- Use the LINQ syntax to retrieve all the rows in the table

```cs
var dbQuery = from emp in employees select emp;
```

- Although `dbQuery` is declared using the var keyword, it returns an
  `IEnumerable` collection, which means that it can be iterated over with a
  foreach loop just like any other collection
- Add this code to output the data:

```cs
foreach (var employee in dbQuery) {
    Console.WriteLine("{0}\t{1} {2}",
        employee.EmployeeID,
        employee.FirstName,
        employee.LastName
    );
}
```

- This approach is simpler as now there's no need to worry about `DataSet` or
  `DataRow` objects

## Output

```console
1 Nancy Davolio
2 Andrew Fuller
3 Janet Leverling
4 Margaret Peacock
5 Steven Buchanan
6 Michael Suyama
7 Robert King
8 Laura Callahan
9 Anne Dodsworth
```

- Using a lambda expression, the equivalent query would be:

```cs
var dbQuery = employees.Select(emp => emp);
```

- LINQ can also be used to access data sources that aren't traditional database
  structures, such as XML files
- Although not covering LINQ to XML specifically, the same LINQ syntax can be
  used with XML Using the

## Object Relational Designer

- Using LINQ to SQL is a lot easier than the ADO.NET syntax used in the previous
  module
- That is still not the easiest way of going about it
- Adding a visual element to database access is where the Object Relational
  Designer comes in
- Create a new console application
- Check the Data Sources to make sure the Northwind database is still accessible
- In the Solution Explorer, right click the project name and select Add -> New
  Item and then select LINQ to SQL Classes
- Two things happen right away:
  - First, the IDE changes to show the Object Relational Designer (O/R
    Designer), which is currently empty
  - The second is that several files are added to the project:
    - `DataClasses1.dbml`
    - `DataClasses1.dbml.layout`
    - `DataClasses1.designer.cs`
- The `.dbml` part indicates this is a `Database` Markup Language file, which is
  really just XML
- Switch to the Server Explorer window, expand `Northwind`, and expand the
  `Tables` folder
- Drag the `Orders` table directly onto the O/R Designer
- Click `Yes` to copy the data if it asks
- The `Orders` table will be represented visually, with icons for each of the
  columns in the table, and a key icon indicating the primary key for this table
- Add the Order `Details` and `Products` tables
- These tables are also represented visually, and the connections are shown
  between them as well
- They can be dragged around to see them better
- The arrows from both the Order and Product tables point towards the Order
  `Details` table
- That's because the primary key from each of those tables is used as a foreign
  key in `Order Details`
- Double clicking on the `DataClasses1.dbml.layout` file will show the markup
  representation of what was just created visually
- For the most part, this file never needs to be looked at, but this is what the
  O/R `Designer` creates automatically
- Opening the `DataClasses1.designer.cs` file shows that it is huge
- This file is automatically generated from the contents of the tables
- It includes properties for every column so that they can be retrieved and/or
  set
- This file shouldn't ever need to be edited either
- So what does all the autogenerated code do?
- It saves the headaches of dealing with databases
- Now can deal with just the minimum amount of code:

```cs
DataClasses1DataContext myContext = new DataClasses1DataContext();
Product foundProduct = myContext.Products.Single(p => p.ProductID == 1);

Console.WriteLine("Found product #{0}, {1}", foundProduct.ProductID, foundProduct.ProductName);

var orderList =
    from order in myContext.Order_Details
    where order.OrderID >= 10250 && order.OrderID <= 10255
    select order;

Console.WriteLine("\nProduct Orders between 10250 and 10255");

foreach(Order_Detail order in orderList) {
    Console.WriteLine("ID: {0}\tQty: {1}\tProduct: {2}", order.OrderID, order.Quantity, order.Product.ProductName);
}
```

## Output

```console
Found product #1, Chai
Product Orders between 10250 and 10255

ID: 10250 Qty: 10 Product: Jack's New England Clam Chowder
ID: 10250 Qty: 35 Product: Manjimup Dried Apples

```

- There are a few differences between this example and the previous one
- First, there is no need to add any using statements
- These are taken care of in the other classes
- Next, `DataClasses1DataContext` is a pregenerated class that knows how to
  access the `Northwind` database already
- All that is needed is to call the constructor so there's no more messing
  around with connection strings
- No additional classes will need to be defined
- No need to define a Table class, or classes to represent the fields in the
  database
- All of that already exists in the `DataClasses1.designer.cs` file
- That means the columns in the database can be treated as regular types:

```cs
Product foundProduct = myContext.Products.Single(p => p.ProductID == 1);
```

- Product isn't defined anywhere
- The O/R Designer did it automatically, but a Product object can be used just
  like any other object
- These classes even have their own methods defined for them, such as
  `Single()`, which is used to retrieve a single record
- A collection can be retrieved using the same LINQ syntax

```cs
var orderList =
    from order in myContext.Order_Details
    where order.OrderID >= 10250 && order.OrderID <= 10255
    select order;
```

- `orderList` is an `IEnumerable` collection of anonymous types, based on the
  return value of the `select` statement
- The equivalent lambda expression would be:

```cs
var orderList = myContext.Order_Details.Where(o => o.OrderID >= 10250 && o.OrderID <= 10255);
```

- Finally, there's one interesting thing in the `WriteLine()` statement:

```cs
Console.WriteLine("ID: {0}\tQty: {1}\tProduct: {2}",
    order.OrderID, order.Quantity, order.Product.ProductName);
```

- The `OrderID` and `Quantity` values were retrieved from the `Order Details`
  table, treating `Order_Details` as though it were an ordinary object
- `ProductName` isn't in the `Order Details` table, though
- The `Order Details` table is related to the `Product` table by the foreign key
  (`ProductID`)
- That means that the `Product` class, and its `ProductID` field, can be
  accessed from `Order_Details` `order.Product.ProductName` returns the desired
  field
- The name of the table is `Order Details` with a space, but C# class names
  can't include spaces, so the Object Relational Designer changes it to an
  underscore
- It may be noticed that when the O/R Designer displays the class name
  graphically, it's singular
- IntelliSense always provides the correct class name
- This is now the point where interacting with the database is nearly invisible
- The LINQ syntax made the querying easier, and the Object Relational Designer
  makes accessing the database easier yet
