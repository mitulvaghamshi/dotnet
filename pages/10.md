## Paging

- If the Index method of a controller returns many items, unlike Web Forms,
  ASP.NET Core MVC doesâ€™t have a built-in ability to page them
- A `PaginatedList` class will be used to implement this functionality

## Generic Type Parameter

- In a generic type or method definition, a type parameter is a placeholder for
  a specific type that a client specifies when they create an instance of the
  generic type
- This allows the method to be flexible and useful in a variety of scenarios
- In the method signature, it is denoted as `<T>`, meaning any type

## IQueryable Interface

- Provides functionality to evaluate queries against a specific data source
  wherein the type of the data is known
- Similar to `IEnumberable` in that it allows the creation (and consumption) of
  a list of stuff, but from a **LINQ** source
- This interface itself implements `IEnumerable`

## LINQ

- Language `INtegrated` Query is a query syntax in C# that allows retrieving
  data from a variety of data sources
  - Object collections
  - ADO.NET DataSets
  - XML documents
  - Entity Framework
  - SQL databases
  - Other data sources

## LINQ Methods

- Skip bypasses a specified number of elements in a sequence and then returns
  the remaining elements
- Take returns a specified number of contiguous elements from the start of a
  sequence
- `FirstOrDefault` returns the first element of a sequence, or a default value
  if no element is found
