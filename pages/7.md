## Introduction to Testing

- Testing is a key part of developing any professional application
- Testing has traditionally been a manual, tedious and expensive process
- Agile development methodologies place even greater emphasis on testing than
  traditional approaches
- Agile development requires lots of repeat (regression) testing so the need for
  test automation is very high
- Visual Studio has extensive support for building and executing automated tests
- ASP.NET MVC, Razor Pages and Web API were designed to be very testable

## Testing Frameworks

- Visual Studio provides an open testing architecture that supports several
  different test frameworks including
  - **Nunit** – Original JUnit port
  - **xUnit** – Updated version of **Nunit**; Emerging as preferred testing tool
  - **MSTest** – Microsoft’s unit testing framework
- The principles for these unit testing frameworks are very similar, so
  transitioning from one to the other is straightforward

## xUnit

- Test actions (methods) are annotated with `[Fact]` or `[Theory]`
- Facts are tests which are always true
- Theories are test which are only true for a particular set of data
- Initialization code that runs before each test is placed in the test class
  constructor

## xUnit Instructions

- Add a `Test Project` to your solution
- Add a reference to the project you would like to test to your test project
- Implement your unit test
- Build your unit test project
- Open Test Explorer and Run the test
- Review the results and modify as necessary

## Unit Testing Web Controllers

- Automated testing depends on known data
- Testing against an actual database is problematic because the contents of the
  database are expected to change over time
- A good alternative is to use a **fake** database
- `Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.InMemory` NuGet package provides an in memory
  simulation of the database context

## Naming Tests

- By convention, the name of a test should consist of three parts:
- The _name_ of the method being tested
- The _scenario_ under which it's being tested
- The _expected behavior_ when the _scenario_ is invoked
- Examples: `Index_NoInput_ReturnsMovies` or `Details_MovieId_ReturnsMovie`

## Unit Tests

- Unit Tests normally consists of three major steps:
  - **Arrange** – create and initializes the object(s) to test
  - **Act** – do something with the object(s)
  - **Assert** – check that the object(s) or result changes to the expected state

## Test Explorer

- Test Explorer is Microsoft’s dedicated Test Tool
- Test Explorer provides support for running tests
- Part of Visual Studio

## Assert

- The `Assert` class has many useful methods for assertions including:
  - `IsType<T>`
  - `True`, `False`
  - `Equal`, `NotEqual`
  - `Same`, `NotSame` (to compare references)
  - `Null`, `NotNull`

## Order of Tests

- Tests are not guaranteed to run in any particular order
- It is best practice that test shouldn’t be ordered
- If it is required to have tests run in a particular order, you must implement
  the `ITestCaseOrderer` or `ITestCollectionOrder` interfaces

## Live Unit Testing

- As you are developing an application, Live Unit Testing automatically runs any
  impacted unit tests in the background and presents the results and code
  coverage live in the Visual Studio IDE in real time
- As you modify your code, Live Unit Testing provides feedback on how your
  changes impacted existing tests and whether the new code you've added is
  covered by one or more existing tests
- Only Visual Studio Enterprise supports this
- This will gently remind you to write unit tests as you are making bug fixes or
  adding new features
- ✅ Code passes test(s)
- ❌ Code fails test(s)
- ➖ Code isn’t covered by a test(s)
- `*` Icons here are not the same as Visual Studio.
