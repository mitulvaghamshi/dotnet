## Authentication vs. Authorization

- Authentication is a process in which a user provides credentials that are then
  compared to those previously stored in an operating system, database, app or
  resource
- If they match, the user authenticates successfully
- Once authenticated a user can then perform actions that they're authorized for
- The authorization refers to the process that determines what a user is allowed
  to do

## Encryption vs. Hashing

- Sensitive data (like passwords) should never be stored in clear text in a
  database
- Two approaches: _Encryption_ or _Hashing_
- An encrypted value can be decrypted back into it’s original clear text value
- Hashing is a one way process, a hash value can not be reconstituted back into
  it’s original clear text value
- Encryption is not secure for long term storage
- It is secure for short term situations (HTTPS sessions)
- Hashing (with __salt__) is more secure and is used by ASP.NET Core Identity
- [https://codebeautify.org/encrypt-decrypt](https://codebeautify.org/encrypt-decrypt)
  - Enter a key (random string for scrambling and unscrambling data)
  - Encrypt some short text
  - Encrypt some longer text, notice the difference
  - Encrypt password, then decrypt it
- [https://codebeautify.org/sha256-hash-generator](https://codebeautify.org/sha256-hash-generator)
  - Hash some short text
  - Hash some longer text, notice the output is same length
  - Hash using the __sha512__ algorithm, notice output is longer

## ASP.NET Core Identity

- ASP.NET Core Identity is a membership system that adds login functionality to
  ASP.NET Core apps
- Users can create an account with the login information stored in Identity or
  they can use an external login provider
- Supported external login providers include Facebook, Google, Microsoft Account
  and Twitter
- Identity can be configured using a SQL Server database (or any other database)
  to store user names, passwords, and profile data
- Alternatively, another persistent store can be used, for example, Azure Table
  Storage

## GDPR

- In 2018, the European Union introduced the General Data Protection Regulation
- ASP.NET Core Identity is compliant with GDPR
- One of the stipulations of GDPR is that users can manage the information that
  an enterprise holds about them

## Authorization

Once authenticated, authorization can be handled A method or a class can be
decorated with the `[Authorize]` or `[AllowAnonymous]` attributes If a
method is decorated with `[Authorize]`, the user must be authenticated to
access it If a class is decorated with `[Authorize]`, all methods require
authentication, unless decorated with `[AllowAnonymous]`

## ASP.NET Core Identity

- When ASP.NET Core Identity is added to a project, it is added as a _Razor
  Class Library_ (RCL)
- A Razor Class Library contains Razor views, pages, controllers, page models,
  Razor components, View components and data models

## Customizing ASP.NET Core Identity

- ASP.NET Core Identity has many points of customization
- `IdentityOptions` allows configuring password, lockout, user options and more
- In order to customize one of the provided endpoints, the identity scaffolder
  must be used to generate the appropriate code

## Select Identity RCL Endpoints

- /Identity/Account/Login
- /Identity/Account/Logout
- /Identity/Account/Manage
- /Identity/Account/Register
