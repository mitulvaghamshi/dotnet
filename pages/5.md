## Introduction to ORM (Object-Relational Mapping)

- There are major differences between relational and object oriented models
  including:
  - __Types__ (e.g. `varchar` vs. `string`)
  - __Identity__ (`keys` vs. `address`)
  - __Relations__ (`foreign keys` vs. `references`)
  - __Many to Many__ relations require linking table in SQL
  - __Inheritance__ and __Polymorphism__ are not directly supported in SQL
- __Object/Relational Mapping__ (ORM or O/RM) maps between these two models allowing
  us to work in the object oriented model without having to worry about the
  underlying data structure
- ORM tools allow us to easily save our objects to the database and load them
  from the database
- ORMs typically provide support for the full set of CRUD operations
- Why would one use an ORM?
  - To save time and money (time to market)
  - To focus on the business logic rather than database/persistence logic

## Introduction to .NET ORM

- First major ORM for .NET was __NHibernate__ which is an open source solution which
  is still around
- .NET provided LINQ to SQL as its first ORM
- .NET now includes the __Entity Framework__ which effectively replaced __LINQ__ to __SQL__
- __Entity Framework__ can be used with many different databases including _MySQL_,
  _Oracle_, _SQL Server_, _SQLite_ and more
- Complete list of [EF Core Database Providers](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/ef/core/providers/index?tabs=dotnet-core-cli)
- [Entity Framework alternatives](https://stackshare.io/entity-framework/alternatives)

## Entity Framework

- Microsoft’s latest ORMs are __Entity Framework 6__ (EF6) and the lighter, portable
  __Entity Framework Core 5__ (EF Core)
- __EF6__ is more mature and slightly richer in functionality than __EF Core__
- However, just like .NET Framework, future development will primarily be with
  __EF Core__
- Good tutorial site:
  [EntityFrameworkTutorial](https://www.entityframeworktutorial.net)

## Performance Considerations

- In general __EF__ generated database access code performs very well, although
  perhaps not quite as well as native SQL and stored procedures
- For the vast majority of applications, __EF__ performance will be more than
  adequate
- On the occasion when __EF__ performance is the bottleneck, it is still possible to
  write native SQL, stored procedures, views and indexes and configure __EF__ to use
  them

## EF Workflows

- __EF Core__ has two workflows and the choice would be depend on the situation
  - __Code__ first can be used for a __new__ application
  - __Database__ first makes sense if a database already exists
- __EF6__ also has a __Model__ first workflow that is similar to __Code__ first, but uses a
  _graphical editor_

## Important Classes

- Main `Context` container class provides access to all of our entities
  - Derives from `DbContext`
  - Uses `DbContextOptions` for configuration information
    - __Database provider__: `UseSqlServer`, `UseSqlite`, etc.
    - __Connection string__
  - Contains `DbSet<T>` members for our strongly typed entities (AKA tables)
  - Provides support for change tracking to our entities
- Entities with the `DbContext` API are __POCO__ (Plain Old CLR Objects) and
  therefore are persistence ignorant

## MVC EF Scaffolding

- __Scaffolding__ in MVC can generate most of our standard CRUD code automatically
  from a model
- __Scaffolding__ will install necessary packages, build the __Controller__ and __Views__,
  register the database and configure its connection

## Asynchronous Programming

- Makes heavy use of asynchronous code, lambda expressions and interfaces
- To improve efficiency, the scaffolder makes extensive use of
  [asynchronous programming](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/async)
  which is helpful for I/O bound code such as file, database and network I/O
- Two C# keywords to note for asynchronous code:
  - **async:** marking a method as making an asynchronous call
  - **await:** relinquishes the current thread to the thread pool while the
    awaited (asynchronous) task operation completes
- Methods that use `async` must also return either a:
  - `Task<return type>` - generic object for methods that would otherwise return
    a plain `return type` e.g. `Task<string>` instead of `string`
  - `Task` – object for methods that would otherwise return `void`
- Methods that do the asynchronous I/O bound processing by convention have
  method names that end in `Async`

## Dependency Injection

- __Dependency Injection__ (DI) is a design pattern
- A dependency is an object that another object depends on (e.g. EF Data Context)
- ASP.NET Core MVC controllers request dependencies via constructors
- DI makes apps easier to test and maintain because they are more **loosely coupled**

## Ensuring the Database Exists

- The `EnsureCreated` method of the `Database` property of the `DatabaseContext`
  ensures that the database for the context exists
- If it exists, no action is taken
- If it does not exist then the database and all its schema are created
- Optionally, the `OnModelCreating` method can be implemented to seed the
  database when it is being created

## Entity Framework

- Changes to entities are tracked automatically by the context
- We can easily save all changes to our entities using the `SaveChanges` method
  of our `DbContext` derived context
- We can query our entities using **LINQ** to `Entities` using __Query Syntax__ or
  __Method Syntax__

## Connection Strings

- __Connection strings__ in .NET Core are the same as in .NET Framework
- Instead of the `web.config` file, they are stored in `appsettings.json`

## SQLite

- __SQLite__ is a small, fast, self-contained, high-reliability, full-featured, SQL
  database engine
- __SQLite__ is the most used database engine in the world
- __SQLite__ is built into all mobile phones and most computers and comes bundled
  inside countless other applications
- [SQLite](https://www.sqlite.org)
