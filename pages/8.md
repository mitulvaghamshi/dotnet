## Database Migrations

- A data model changes during development and gets out of sync with the database
- You can drop the database and let **EF** create a new one that matches the
  model, but this procedure results in the loss of data
- The migrations feature in **EF Core** provides a way to incrementally update
  the database schema to keep it in sync with the application's data model while
  preserving existing data in the database
- Database migrations are handled through the **Package Manager Console** with
  two commands:
  - **Add-Migration**: scaffolds a migration script for any pending model
    changes
  - **Update-Database**: applies any pending migrations to the database

## Maximum Length

- Configuring a maximum length provides a hint to the database provider about
  the appropriate column data type to choose for a given property
- Maximum length only applies to array data types, such as `string` and `byte[]`
- Avoiding `varchar(max)` when possible, will produce more **efficient SQL**

## Relating Entities

- **`Navigation` property**: a property defined on the parent and/or child
  entity that contains a reference(s) to the other entity(s)
  - **Collection navigation property**: navigation property that contains
    references to many related entities
  - **Reference navigation property**: navigation property that holds a
    reference to a single related entity
- A `List<T>` can be used on the **parent** entity
- A `ForeignKey` attribute is used on the **child** entity

## Loading Related Data

- With navigation properties, **EF Core** allows the model to load related
  entities
- There are three common O/RM patterns used to load related data:
  - _Eager_ loading (achieved with Include method)
  - _Explicit_ loading
  - _Lazy_ loading (_default_)
- **Eager** loading means that the related data is loaded from the database as
  part of the initial query
- **Explicit** loading means that the related data is explicitly loaded from the
  database at a later time
- **Lazy** loading means that the related data is transparently loaded from the
  database when the navigation property is accessed
