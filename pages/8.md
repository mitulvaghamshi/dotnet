## Database Migrations

- A data model changes during development and gets out of sync with the database
- You can drop the database and let __EF__ create a new one that matches the model,
  but this procedure results in the loss of data
- The migrations feature in __EF Core__ provides a way to incrementally update the
  database schema to keep it in sync with the application's data model while
  preserving existing data in the database
- Database migrations are handled through the __Package Manager Console__ with two
  commands:
  - **Add-Migration**: scaffolds a migration script for any pending model changes
  - **Update-Database**: applies any pending migrations to the database

## Maximum Length

- Configuring a maximum length provides a hint to the database provider about
  the appropriate column data type to choose for a given property
- Maximum length only applies to array data types, such as `string` and `byte[]`
- Avoiding `varchar(max)` when possible, will produce more __efficient SQL__

## Relating Entities

- __`Navigation` property__: a property defined on the parent and/or child entity
  that contains a reference(s) to the other entity(s)
  - __Collection navigation property__: navigation property that contains references
    to many related entities
  - __Reference navigation property__: navigation property that holds a reference to
    a single related entity
- A `List<T>` can be used on the **parent** entity
- A `ForeignKey` attribute is used on the **child** entity

## Loading Related Data

- With navigation properties, __EF Core__ allows the model to load related entities
- There are three common O/RM patterns used to load related data:
  - _Eager_ loading (achieved with Include method)
  - _Explicit_ loading
  - _Lazy_ loading (_default_)
- __Eager__ loading means that the related data is loaded from the database as part
  of the initial query
- __Explicit__ loading means that the related data is explicitly loaded from the
  database at a later time
- __Lazy__ loading means that the related data is transparently loaded from the
  database when the navigation property is accessed
