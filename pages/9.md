## Scaffolding

- The scaffolder can reverse engineer a model from an existing database by using
  the `Scaffold-DbContext` command from the **Package Manager Console**
- This is the **database first** workflow

## Scaffold-DbContext

### `-Connection <String>`

- The connection string to the database
- The value can be `name=<name of connection string>`
- In that case the name comes from the configuration sources that are set up for
  the project (`appsettings.json`)
- This is a positional parameter and is required

### `-Provider <String>`

- The provider to use
- Typically this is the name of the **NuGet** package, e.g.
  `Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.SqlServer`
- This is a positional parameter and is required

### `-OutputDir <String>`

- The directory to put files in
- Paths are relative to the project directory

### `-ContextDir <String>`

- The directory to put the `DbContext` file in
- Paths are relative to the project directory

### `-Context <String>`

- The name of the `DbContext` class to generate

### `-Schemas <String[]>`

- The schemas of tables to generate entity types for
- If this parameter is omitted, all schemas are included

### `-Tables <String[]>`

- The tables to generate entity types for
- If this parameter is omitted, all tables are included

### `-DataAnnotations`

- Use attributes to configure the model (where possible)
- If this parameter is omitted, only the fluent API is used

### `-UseDatabaseNames`

- Use table and column names exactly as they appear in the database
- If this parameter is omitted, database names are changed to more closely
  conform to C# name style conventions

### `-Force`

- Overwrite existing files

## Data Annotations vs. Fluent API

- Data Annotations example

```cs
[Required]
[StringLength(160)]
public string Title { get; set; }
```

- Fluent API is an alternative way to configure the data model;

```cs
entity.Property(e => e.Title)
    .IsRequired()
    .HasMaxLength(160);
```

## Running

- Visual Studio offers 3 ways to run your site
- **F5** offers full debugging which allows interactive breakpoints
- **Ctrl+F5** runs without debugging, which runs slightly faster
- Both approaches permit making changes and refreshing browser without
  relaunching
- The 3rd way is to use the dotnet command in the **Package Manager Console**
  (PMC)
- `dotnet watch run --project projectname`
- `dotnet watch` will automatically refresh the browser whenever a file change
  is detected in the project

## No Tracking

- The `AsNoTracking` method returns a new query where the change tracker will
  not track any of the entities that are returned
- If the entity instances are modified, this will not be detected by the change
  tracker and `SaveChanges()` will not persist those changes to the database
- Disabling change tracking is useful for _read-only_ scenarios because it
  avoids the overhead of setting up change tracking for each entity instance
- You should not disable change tracking if you want to manipulate entity
  instances and persist those changes to the database using `SaveChanges()`

## Form Tag Helpers

- Tag Helpers enable _server-side_ code to participate in creating and rendering
  HTML elements in Razor files
- The `asp-route-<Parameter Name>` attribute, where `<Parameter Name>` is added
  to the route values
