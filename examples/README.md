# Walkthrough Examples

Examples are created with Visual Studio 2022, SQL Server 2022, and .NET 6.0. All code remains same with slight less code compared to walkthrough which are written in 2021.

## Changes includes:

- These examples does not contain `Startup.cs` file, code from this file is now combined into `Program.cs`.
- Project usage new implicite globals, means no `Program.cs` does not contain any `class` or `Main` method definitions.
- All example were removed bootstrap `libs` which you can download [here](lib.zip) and place inside `wwwroot/` folder (e.g. wwwroot/lib/).
