## Authentication vs. Authorization

- Authentication is a process in which a user provides credentials that are then compared to those previously stored in an operating system, database, app or resource
- If they match, the user authenticates successfully
- Once authenticated a user can then perform actions that they're authorized for
- The authorization refers to the process that determines what a user is allowed to do

## Encryption vs. Hashing

- Sensitive data (like passwords) should never be stored in clear text in a database
- Two approaches: __Encryption__ or __Hashing__
- An __encrypted__ value can be __decrypted__ back into it’s original clear text value
- __Hashing__ is a one way process, a hash value can not be reconstituted back into it’s original clear text value
- __Encryption__ is not secure for long term storage
- It is secure for short term situations (HTTPS sessions)
- __Hashing__ (with __salt__) is more secure and is used by ASP.NET Core __Identity__

  - Enter a key (random string for scrambling and unscrambling data)
  - Encrypt some short text
  - Encrypt some longer text, notice the difference
  - Encrypt password, then decrypt it
- [https://codebeautify.org/sha256-hash-generator](https://codebeautify.org/sha256-hash-generator)
  - Hash some short text
  - Hash some longer text, notice the output is same length
  - Hash using the __sha512__ algorithm, notice output is longer

## ASP.NET Core Identity

- ASP.NET Core __Identity__ is a membership system that adds login functionality to ASP.NET Core apps
- Users can create an account with the login information stored in __Identity__ or they can use an __external__ login provider
- Supported external login providers include __Facebook__, __Google__, __Microsoft__ Account and __Twitter__
- __Identity__ can be configured using a __SQL Server__ database (or any other database) to store user names, passwords, and profile data
- Alternatively, another persistent store can be used, for example, __Azure Table Storage__

## General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)

- In 2018, the _European Union_ introduced the GDPR
- ASP.NET Core __Identity__ is compliant with GDPR
- One of the stipulations of GDPR is that users can manage the information that an enterprise holds about them

## Authorization

- Once authenticated, authorization can be handled
- A `method` or a `class` can be __decorated__ with the `[Authorize]` or `[AllowAnonymous]` attributes
- If a `method` is __decorated__ with `[Authorize]`, the user must be authenticated to access it
- If a `class` is __decorated__ with `[Authorize]`, all __methods__ require authentication, unless decorated with `[AllowAnonymous]`

## ASP.NET Core Identity

- When ASP.NET Core __Identity__ is added to a project, it is added as a _Razor Class Library_ (RCL)
- A _Razor Class Library_ contains `Razor views`, `pages`, `controllers`, `page models`, `Razor components`, `View components` and `data models`

## Customizing ASP.NET Core Identity

- ASP.NET Core __Identity__ has many points of customization
- `IdentityOptions` allows configuring password, lockout, user options and more
- In order to customize one of the provided endpoints, the identity scaffolder must be used to generate the appropriate code

- /Identity/Account/Logout
- /Identity/Account/Manage
- /Identity/Account/Register
