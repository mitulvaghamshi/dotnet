## Web Forms

- ASP.NET uses the concept of the “web form”, similar to Windows Forms
- A web form is made up of two files
- Filename.aspx (markup)
- Filename.aspx.cs (code-behind)
- The ASP.NET engine renders standards-based HTML and JavaScript code
- Startup page is Default.aspx

## Three Types of Markup

| Type              | Example                                                    | Comment                                                                                           |
| ----------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Standard HTML     | `<h1>Heading</h1>`                                         |                                                                                                   |
| Inline expression | `<%: Title %>`                                             | From classic ASP: Execute statements, Call functions, Access properties, Directives, Data-binding |
| Web form control  | `<asp:Button ID="Button1" runat="server" Text="Button" />` | Can be manipulated in code-behind file.                                                           |

## Web Form Controls

- Standard
  - Buttons, text boxes, labels, …
- Rich
  - Calendars, wizards, …
- Validation
  - Client-side validation
- Data
  - GridView, Repeater, …
- Many more

## Event Model

- `Page_Load` routine used for initializations
- Buttons have click events just like in windows forms
- Programming intuitive and very similar to windows forms

## Page Events

1. PreInit
2. Init
3. InitComplete
4. PreLoad
5. Load
6. LoadComplete
7. Control Events
8. PreRender
9. PreRenderComplete
10. SaveStateComplete
11. Unload

## Creating a Web Form

- Type on design surface and drag controls onto it
- Or edit in Source mode
- Controls can also be dragged into Source mode

## Add an Event Handler

- Double click a button and write code
- Just like Windows Form programming
- Or wire up your own event handlers to handle events from multiple controls

## State

- ASP.NET simplifies web programming by automatically maintaining state on page
  when posting back to the same page
  - Known as a postback
- Most other web development environments force you to manage state yourself
  - Non-trivial
- State is not stored on the server
  - Good for scalability
  - Implemented using a hidden HTML field: `__VIEWSTATE`

## Master Pages

- When creating a site with many pages, master pages provides an easy way to
  control the look and feel of all pages
- A master page is a “template” that will frame how all pages on the site look
- Master pages can contain controls and code like any other ASP.NET page
- A web site may have multiple master pages
- A style sheet can be linked to any page, but linking to a master page causes
  it’s effect to spread to many pages

## Content Place Holders

- `ContentPlaceHolders` define regions for content in an ASP.NET master page
- This is where content will show up on actual pages
- `ContentPlaceHolders` should be empty on the master page
- `ContentPlaceHolders` will contain HTML, controls, etc. on content pages

## SqlDataSource

- The `SqlDataSource` data source control represents data in an SQL relational
  database to data-bound controls
- Can be connected to a variety of controls including the `GridView` and
  `DropDownList`
- Uses a connection string to connect to the database

## Connection Strings

- Connection strings should be stored in `web.config`
  - More secure
  - If it needs to change, only one place
  - Better performance due to connection pooling
  - Default behaviour
- `SQL Server` connection strings can be specified in a variety of ways, the
  most common approach has three required parts:
  - `Data Source` (where is the database server)
  - `Initial Catalog` (which database is being used)
  - `Authentication Credentials` (how does the application login to the
    database)

## GridView

- A `GridView` renders as a table to the end user
- Like many ASP.NET controls, clicking `>` will render a task window
- Selecting Edit Columns… task will allow control of what columns are displayed
  and how they are displayed

## GridView Columns

- Common DataFormatString values
  - {0:c} Currency
  - {0:d} Short date
  - {0:n2} Numeric with 2 decimal places
- To right justify numeric columns
  - Expand ItemStyle
  - Set HorizontalAlign to Right

## GridView Tasks

- Paging
- Sorting
- Editing
  - Data source must support this by including primary key
- Deleting
