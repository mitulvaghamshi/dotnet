# Walkthrough Examples

Examples are created with Visual Studio 2022, SQL Server 2022, and .NET v6.0 and v7.0. All code remains same with slight less code compared to walkthrough which are written in 2021.

## Changes:

- These examples does not contain `Startup.cs` file, code from this file is now combined into `Program.cs`.
- Project usage new implicite globals, means the `Program.cs` file does not contain any `class` or `Main` method definition, as per new style.
- All example were removed `bootstrap lib`s which you can download [here](../resources/bootstrap-lib.zip) and place inside `wwwroot/` folder (e.g. `wwwroot/lib/`).
