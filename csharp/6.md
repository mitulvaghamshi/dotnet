# Delegates and Events

- Often situations where a particular action needs to be executed, but it's not
  known in advance which method or object will be called upon to execute it
- Wish to tell an object to play a media file at runtime, but unsure of what
  object will be playing the file:
  - Video
  - Sound
  - Animation
- Instead of hardcoding a particular media player object, create a delegate, and
  then resolve that delegate to a particular method when the program executes
- Originally, a program would begin execution and then proceed through its steps
  until it completed
- If there was user interaction, it was strictly controlled and limited to
  specific times in the execution
- Today's graphical user interface (GUI) programming model uses a different
  approach known as event-driven programming
- A program presents the user interface and waits for the user to take an action
- Choose a menu selection, push a button, update a text field, click an icon,
  etc
- Each action causes an event to be raised
- Other events can be raised without direct user action
- Timer clicks, email being received, file-copy actions, etc
- An event is the encapsulation of the idea that "something happened" to which
  the program must respond
- Events and delegates are tightly coupled concepts because flexible event
  handling requires that the response to the event be dispatched to the
  appropriate event handler
- Event handlers are implemented via a delegate

## Delegates

- A delegate is a reference type that doesn't refer to an object, but instead
  refers to a method
- This is called encapsulating the method
- When a delegate is created, a method signature and return type is specified
- Any matching method can be encapsulated with that delegate

```cs
public delegate int FindResult(Object obj1, Object obj2);
```

- This declaration defines a delegate named FindResult, which will encapsulate
  any method that takes two Objects as parameters and returns an int
- Once a delegate is defined, a member method can be encapsulated with that
  delegate
- Create an instance of that delegate and passing in a method that matches the
  return type and signature
- The delegate has no method body
- The method is not being defined
- The delegate doesn't care what the method does or how it does it, as long as
  it has the right parameters and return type
- An alternative to delegates is to use anonymous methods or lambda expressions
- Delegates decouple the class that declares the delegate from the class that
  uses the delegate
- The class that declares the delegate FindResult doesn't need to know how the
  result is found, or even what class uses the delegate, it only needs to get an
  int back
- Assume a class called `MediaStorage` that stores and manages various media
  files
- This class reports whether the files can be played properly or not as a way of
  testing their validity
- The `MediaStorage` class doesn't need to know how to play the files it just
  needs a success code
- The delegate declaration in `MediaStorage` is simple:

```cs
public delegate int PlayMedia();
```

- A return value of 0 will indicate success, anything else will indicate failure
- The only other method in `MediaStorage` is `ReportResult()` which outputs the
  result:

```cs
public void ReportResult(PlayMedia playerDelegate) {
    if (playerDelegate() == 0) {
        Console.WriteLine("Media played successfully");
    } else {
        Console.WriteLine("Media did not play successfully");
    }
}
```

- Looking like a normal method, it takes `playerDelegate`, which isn't a normal
  type like an int, but is a delegate
- In the body of the method, `playerDelegate` isn't declared directly as an
  integer because it's a reference to a method
- The method that the delegate points to is evaluated and the result is compared
  to 0
- Here's one of the media player classes:

```cs
public class AudioPlayer {
    private int audioPlayerStatus;

    public int PlayAudioFile() {
        Console.WriteLine("Simulating playing an audio file here.");

        audioPlayerStatus = 0;
        return audioPlayerStatus;
    }
}
```

- This class has one private internal member and a simple public method that
  simulates playing an audio file a returns a status code in the form of an int
- Since this method has the proper signature it can be used with the delegate
- Another class VideoPlayer will have a similar method
- In the body of the program, the `MediaStorage`class needs to be instantiated,
  and each one of the classes

```cs
MediaStorage myMediaStorage = new MediaStorage();
AudioPlayer myAudioPlayer   = new AudioPlayer();
VideoPlayer myVideoPlayer   = new VideoPlayer();
```

- Then the delegates needs to be instantiated
- Delegates are of the type `MediaStorage.PlayMedia`

```cs
// instantiate the delegates
MediaStorage.PlayMedia audioPlayerDelegate =
    new MediaStorage.PlayMedia(myAudioPlayer.PlayAudioFile);
MediaStorage.PlayMedia videoPlayerDelegate =
    new MediaStorage.PlayMedia(myVideoPlayer.PlayVideoFile);
```

- Delegates are used with the `ReportResult()` method to see if the media files
  were valid

```cs
myMediaStorage.ReportResult(audioPlayerDelegate);
myMediaStorage.ReportResult(videoPlayerDelegate);
```

- The outcome of this is the first line causes `ReportResult()` to call the
  `PlayAudioFile()` method, but the second line causes it to call the
  `PlayVideoFile()` method
- At compile time, `ReportResult()` doesn't know which method it is going to
  call
- It finds out only when it is invoked at runtime
- All it needs to know is that any method it will be asked to call will match
  the signature defined by the `PlayMedia` delegate
- Working with delegates seems complicated at first but it's just passing a
  reference to a method

```cs
public class MediaStorage {
    public delegate int PlayMedia();

    public void ReportResult(PlayMedia playerDelegate) {
        if (playerDelegate() == 0) {
            Console.WriteLine("Media played successfully.");
        } else {
            Console.WriteLine("Media did not play successfully.");
        }
    }
}

public class AudioPlayer {
    private int audioPlayerStatus;

    public int PlayAudioFile() {
        Console.WriteLine("Simulating playing an audio file here.");

        audioPlayerStatus = 0;
        return audioPlayerStatus;
    }
}

public class VideoPlayer {
    private int videoPlayerStatus;

    public int PlayVideoFile() {
        Console.WriteLine("Simulating a failed video file here.");

        videoPlayerStatus = -1;
        return videoPlayerStatus;
    }
}

public class Tester {
    public static void Main(string[] args) {
        MediaStorage myMediaStorage = new MediaStorage();

        // instantiate the two media players
        AudioPlayer myAudioPlayer = new AudioPlayer();
        VideoPlayer myVideoPlayer = new VideoPlayer();

        // instantiate the delegates
        MediaStorage.PlayMedia audioPlayerDelegate =
            new MediaStorage.PlayMedia(myAudioPlayer.PlayAudioFile);
        MediaStorage.PlayMedia videoPlayerDelegate =
            new MediaStorage.PlayMedia(myVideoPlayer.PlayVideoFile);

        // call the delegates
        myMediaStorage.ReportResult(audioPlayerDelegate);
        myMediaStorage.ReportResult(videoPlayerDelegate);
    }
}
```

- Just for variety, the video player class returns an error code

## Output

```console
Simulating playing an audio file here.
    Media played successfully.
Simulating a failed video file here.
    Media did not play successfully.
```

## Events

- GUIs, such as Microsoft Windows and web browsers, require that programs
  respond to events
- An event might be a button click, a menu selection, the completion of a file
  transfer, etc
- Something happens and it must be responded to
- The order in which events arise cannot be predicted
- The system is quiet until the event, and then springs into action to handle it
- In a GUI environment, any number of controls can raise an event
- Clicking a button might raise the Click event
- Adding to a dropdown list might raise the ListChanged event
- Other classes will be interested in responding to these events
- How they respond is not of interest to the class raising the event
- The button says, "I was clicked," and the responding classes react
  appropriately

## Publishing and Subscribing

- Any object can publish a set of events to which other classes can subscribe
- When the publishing class raises an event, all the subscribed classes are
  notified
- A button might notify any number of interested classes when it is clicked
- The button is the publisher because the button publishes the Clickevent
- The other classes are the subscribers because they subscribe to the Clickevent
- The publishing class does not know or care who subscribes, it just raises the
  event
- A Clock might notify interested classes whenever the time changes by one
  second
- The Clock class could itself be responsible for the user interface
  representation of the time, rather than raising the event, so why bother with
  the indirection of using delegates?
- The advantage of the publish/subscribe idiom is that the Clock class doesn't
  need to know how its information will be used
- The monitoring of the time is decoupled from the representation of that
  information
- Any number of classes can be notified by an event
- Subscribing classes do not need to know how the Clock works and the Clock does
  not need to know what they are going to do in response to the event
- The subscribing classes don't need to know about each other either
- The publisher and the subscriber are decoupled by the delegate making for
  flexible and robust code
- The Clock can change how it detects time without breaking any of the
  subscribing classes
- The subscribing classes can change how they respond to time changes without
  breaking the Clock

## Events and Delegates

- Events are implemented with delegates
- The publishing class defines a delegate
- The subscribing class creates a method that matches the signature of the
  delegate and then it creates an instance of that delegate type encapsulating
  that method
- When the event is raised, the subscribing class's methods are invoked through
  the delegate
- A method that handles an event is called an event handler
- Event handlers in the .NET Framework always return void and take two
  parameters
- The first is the "source" of the event (publishing object)
- The second is an object derived from EventArgs
- EventArgs is the base class for all event data
- Other than its constructor, the EventArgs class inherits all its methods from
  Object
- It does add a public static field named Empty which represents an event with
  no state
- By taking a parameter of type EventArgs, the subscriber might use all, some,
  or none of the information passed in
- Create a Clock class that uses delegates to notify potential subscribers
  whenever the time changes its value by one second

```cs
public delegate void SecondChangeHandler(Object Clock, TimeInfoEventArgs timeInformation);
```

- This delegate will encapsulate any method that returns void and takes two
  parameters
- The first is an Object that represents the Clock
- The second is an object of type TimeInfoEventArgsderived from EventArgsthat
  will contain useful information for anyone interested in this event
- TimeInfoEventArgs is defined as:

```cs
public class TimeInfoEventArgs: EventArgs {
    public int hour;
    public int minute;
    public int second;

    public TimeInfoEventArgs(int hour, int minute, int second) {
        this.hour = hour;
        this.minute = minute;
        this.second = second;
    }
}
```

- The `TimeInfoEventArgs` object will have information about the current hour,
  minute and second
- In addition to its delegate, the Clock class has three member variables, hour,
  minute, and second, as well as a single method, `Run()`
- `Run()` creates an infinite loop that periodically checks the system time
- If the time has changed from the Clock object's current time, it notified all
  of its subscribers and updates its own state
- The first step is to sleep for 100 milliseconds
- A static method of the `Thread` class from the `System.Threading` namespace
  serves the function of making the program check the clock every 100
  milliseconds
- After sleeping, the method checks the current time
- About every 10 times it checks, the second will have increments
- The method notifies its subscribers, creating a new
  `TimeInfoEventEventsobject`
- Then it notifies the subscribers by firing the `SecondChangedevent`
- If an event has no subscribers registered, it will evaluate to null
- Like all events, `SecondChanged` takes two arguments, the source and the
  object derived from `EventArgs`
- Raising the event will invoke whatever methods have been registered with the
  `Clock` class through the delegate
- Once the event is raised, update the state of the `Clock` class
- All that is left is to create classes that subscribe to this event
- First will be the `DisplayClock` class
- Displays the current time to the console, but doesn't keep track of the
  current time
- `DisplayClock` will have two methods
- A helper method called `Subscribe()` that is used to subscribe to the clock's
  `SecondChangeddelegate`
- The second method is the event handler `TimeHasChanged()`
- `Subscribe()` creates a new `SecondChangeHandler` delegate, passing in its
  event handler method `TimeHasChanged()`
- It then registers that delegate with the `SecondChanged` event of `Clock`
- The `+=` operator is the mechanism by which classes can register their event
  handlers with the event
- The `+=` operator allows multiple classes to register handlers for a single
  event
- Delegates with multiple subscribers are called multicast delegates
- A second class, `LogCurrentTime`, will also respond to this event
- All that remains is to create a `Clock` class, create the `DisplayClock`
  class, and tell it to respond to the event
- Then create a `LogCurrentTime` class and tell it to subscribe as well
- Finally, tell the `Clock` to run
- Implement events with delegates by setting up a publishing class with a
  delegate and subscribing classes that handle the event

```cs
// a class to hold the information about the event
// in this case it will hold only information
// available in the clock class, but could hold
// additional state information
public class TimeInfoEventArgs: EventArgs {
    public int hour;
    public int minute;
    public int second;

    public TimeInfoEventArgs(int hour, int minute, int second) {
        this.hour = hour;
        this.minute = minute;
        this.second = second;
    }
}

// The publisher: the class that other classes
// will observe. This class publishes one delegate: SecondChangeHandler.
public class Clock {
    private int hour;
    private int minute;
    private int second;

    // the delegate the subscribers must implement
    public delegate void SecondChangeHandler(Object clock, TimeInfoEventArgs timeInformation);

    // an instance of the delegate
    public SecondChangeHandler SecondChanged;

    // set the clock running
    // it will raise an event for each new second
    public void Run() {
        for ( ; ; ) {
            Thread.Sleep(100); // sleep 100 milliseconds

            // get the current time
            System.DateTime dt = System.DateTime.Now;

            // if the second has changed notify the subscribers
            if (dt.Second != second) {
                // create the TimeInfoEventArgs object to pass to the subscriber
                TimeInfoEventArgs timeInformation =
                    new TimeInfoEventArgs(dt.Hour, dt.Minute, dt.Second);

                // if anyone has subscribed, notify them
                if (SecondChanged != null) {
                    SecondChanged(this, timeInformation);
                }
            }

            // update the state
            this.second = dt.Second;
            this.minute = dt.Minute;
            this.hour = dt.Hour;
        }
    }
}

// A subscriber: DisplayClock subscribes to the clock's events.
// The job of DisplayClock is to display the current time
public class DisplayClock {
    // given a clock, subscribe to its SecondChangeHandler event
    public void Subscribe(Clock theClock) {
        theClock.SecondChanged += new Clock.SecondChangeHandler(TimeHasChanged);
    }

    // the method that implements the delegated functionality
    public void TimeHasChanged(Object theClock, TimeInfoEventArgs ti) {
        Console.WriteLine("Current Time: {0}:{1}:{2}",
            ti.hour, ti.minute, ti.second);
    }
}

// a second subscriber whose job is to write to a file
public class LogCurrentTime {
    public void Subscribe(Clock theClock) {
        theClock.SecondChanged += new Clock.SecondChangeHandler(WriteLogEntry);
    }

    // this method should write to a file
    // we write to the console to see the effect this object keeps no state
    public void WriteLogEntry(Object theClock, TimeInfoEventArgs ti) {
        Console.WriteLine("Logging to file: {0}:{1}:{2}",
            ti.hour, ti.minute, ti.second);
    }
}

public class Tester {
    public static void Main() {
        // create a new clock
        Clock theClock = new Clock();

        // create the display and tell it to subscribe to the clock just created
        DisplayClock dc = new DisplayClock(); dc.Subscribe(theClock);

        // create a Log object and tell it to subscribe to the clock
        LogCurrentTime lct = new LogCurrentTime(); lct.Subscribe(theClock);

        // Get the clock started
        theClock.Run();
    }
}
```

- To terminate this application, press `Ctrl+C`

## Output

```console
Current Time: 3:14:41
    Logging to file: 3:14:41
Current Time: 3:14:42
    Logging to file: 3:14:42
Current Time: 3:14:43
    Logging to file: 3:14:43
Current Time: 3:14:44
    Logging to file: 3:14:44
Current Time: 3:14:45
    Logging to file: 3:14:45
Current Time: 3:14:46
    Logging to file: 3:14:46
```

- This code creates two classes, `DisplayClock` and `LogCurrentTime`, both of
  which subscribe to a third class's event (`Clock.SecondChanged`)
- `SecondChangedis` a multicast delegate field Solving Problems with Delegates
- What if the `LogCurrentTime` class was not considerate and it used the
  assignment operator (`=`) instead of the subscribe operator (`+=`)

```cs
public void Subscribe(Clock theClock) {
    theClock.SecondChanged =
        new Clock.SecondChangeHandler(WriteLogEntry);
}
```

- If that small change is made, the `WriteLogEntry()` method is called, but the
  `TimeHasChanged()` method is not called
- The assignment operator replaced the delegate held in the `SecondChanged`
  multicast delegate
- A second problem is that other methods can call `SecondChangeHandler` directly
- Add the following code to the Tester class:

```cs
Console.WriteLine("Calling the method directly!");

System.DateTime dt = System.DateTime.Now.AddHours(2);

TimeInfoEventArgs timeInformation =
     new TimeInfoEventArgs(dt.Hour, dt.Minute, dt.Second);

theClock.SecondChanged(theClock, timeInformation);
```

- Here, `Main()` has created its own `TimeInfoEventArgs` object and invoked
  `SecondChanged` directly Calling the method directly!

## Output

```console
Current Time: 5:14:41
Logging to file: 5:14:41
Current Time: 3:14:42
Logging to file: 3:14:42
Current Time: 3:14:43
Logging to file: 3:14:43
```

- The problem is that the designer of the `Clock` class intended the methods
  encapsulated by the delegate to be invoked only when the event is fired
- `Main()` has gone around through the back door and invoked those methods
  itself
- What's more, it has passes bogus data (passing in a time construct set to two
  hours into the future)
- How can the designer of the Clock class ensure that no one calls the delegated
  method directly?
- Making the delegate private prevents clients from registering the delegate at
  all

## The event Keyword

- The solution to this dilemma is to use the event keyword
- The event keyword indicates to the compiler that the delegate can be invoked
  only by the defining class, and that other classes can subscribe to and
  unsubscribe from the delegate using only the appropriate `+=` and `-=`
  operators
- The fix is to change the definition of `SecondChanged`:

```cs
public SecondChangeHandler SecondChanged;
```

- To the following:

```cs
public event SecondChangeHandler SecondChanged;
```

- Adding the event keyword fixes both problems
- Classes can no longer attempt to subscribe to the event using the assignment
  operator (`=`)
- Classes can no longer invoke the event directly
- Either attempt now creates a compile error
- `SecondChanged` is an event, implemented by a delegate of type
  `SecondChangeHandler`
- The next example shows the addition of the one keyword, event, to the program

## Using Anonymous Methods

- In the previous example, the event was subscribed to by invoking a new
  instance of the delegate, passing in the name of a method that implements the
  event:

```cs
theClock.SecondChanged += new Clock.SecondChangeHandler(TimeHasChanged);
```

- This delegate can be assigned using shortened code:

```cs
theClock.SecondChanged += TimeHasChanged;
```

- Later, `TimeHasChanged` must be defined as a method that matches the signature
  of the `SecondChangeHandler` delegate:

```cs
public void TimeHasChanged(Object theClock, TimeInfoEventArts ti) {
    Console.WriteLine("Current Time: {0}:{1}:{2}",
        ti.hour, ti.minute, ti.second);
}
```

- Anonymous methods allow a code block to be passed rather than the name of the
  method
- This can make for code that is more efficient and easier to maintain, and the
  anonymous method has access to variables in the scope in which they are
  defined

```cs
clock.SecondChanged += delegate(Object theClock, TimeInfoEventArgs ti) {
    Console.WriteLine("Current Time: {0}:{1}:{2}",
        ti.hour, ti.minute, ti.second);
};
```

- Instead of registering a delegate instance, delegateis used, followed by the
  method parameters, followed by the method body encased in braces and
  terminated by a semicolon
- The method has no name, hence, it is anonymous and cannot be invoked except
  through the delegate

## Lambda Expressions

- C# 3.0 extended the concept of anonymous methods and introduced lambda
  expressions, which are more powerful and flexible than anonymous methods
- A lambda expression is defined using this syntax:

```cs
(input parameters) => { /* expression or statement block */ };
```

- The lambda operator `=>` is read as "goes to"
- The left operand is a list of zero or more input parameters, and the right
  operand is the body of lambda expression
- A lambda expression is an expression that returns a method, but it's not a
  method itself
- The delegate definition can be rewritten as:

```cs
clock.SecondChanged += (theClock, ti) => {
    Console.WriteLine("Current Time: {0}:{1}:{2}",
        ti.hour, ti.minute, ti.second);
};
```

- This is read as "clock's `SecondChanged` delegate adds an anonymous delegate
  defined by this lambda expression"
- The two input parameters, theClock and ti, are of type `Clock` and
  `TimeInfoEventArgs`, respectively
- The types don't need to be specified, because the C# compiler infers their
  type from the `SecondChanged` delegate definition
- If the compiler is unable to infer the type of the operands, they may be
  expressed explicitly:

```cs
(Clock theClock, TimeInfoEventArgs ti) => { /* ... */ };
```

- When specified, the types make the code more readable
- If the method doesn't have any parameters, write a pair of empty parentheses:

```cs
() => { Console.WriteLine("No parameters here."); }
```

- If there is only one parameter, omit the parentheses:

```cs
n => { n * n };
```

- If the method only has one statement, omit the braces too:

```cs
n => n * n;
```

- What's the difference between lambda expressions and anonymous methods?
- Anonymous methods were introduced in C# 2.0 specifically to deal with
  situations where a definition for a method for a delegate wasn't desired
- That's why anonymous methods use the `delegate` keyword and can only be used
  in the context of delegates
- Lambda expressions were introduced in C# 3.0 to take the idea further
- Specifically, lambda expressions were introduced to work with LINQ, the
  Language Integrated Query, which has to do with handling data
