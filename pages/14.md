## Customizing the User

- The user object in **Core Identity** is based on the
  [IdentityUser](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/microsoft.aspnetcore.identity.identityuser?view=aspnetcore-5.0)
  class
- To customize the user, a new `model` is created that _inherits_ from
  `IdentityUser`
- By convention, this new model should be named `ApplicationUser`
- **Decorating** any new properties with `[PersonalData]` ensures that they are
  downloaded from the **PersonalData** page
- `IdentityUser` will have been used throughout the project and will need to be
  updated to `ApplicationUser`

## UserManager Class

- Provides the APIs for managing user in a persistence store
- Using the
  [UserManager](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/microsoft.aspnetcore.identity.usermanager-1?view=aspnetcore-3.1)
  instead of interacting with the database directly allows less impact if the
  persistence store should ever change

## Role Based Security

- In an enterprise of any size, there will be a variety of employees performing
  a variety of tasks
- People change jobs, get promoted, leave the company on an ongoing basis
- Considering these changes, security best practice is to assign security
  privileges based on role
- Each enterprise would define roles that made sense for it, e.g.
  - Admin, Manager, Clerk, Trainee
  - Executive, Manager, Support, Faculty, Student
  - Admin, Full time employee, Part time employee
- It is possible for an employee to participate in more than one role, for
  example Admin and Manager
