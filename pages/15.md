## Razor Pages

- Razor Pages provide an alternative to MVC in .NET Core, introduced with
  ASP.NET Core 2.0
- A project can mix and match MVC with Razor Pages
- Razor Pages are just as testable as MVC
- Razor Pages also support dependency injection
- The initial setup of a Razor Pages project has similarities to MVC and
  differences
- There is a `wwwroot` folder for static content
- Instead of a `Controllers` and `View` folder, there is a `Pages` folder
- The `Pages` folder represents the root of the project and all Razor pages will
  be placed here
- Razor Pages don't define endpoints through `Controllers` and `Actions`
- Each Razor Page endpoint is a `.cshtml` file with a `.cshtml.cs` backing file that
  provides logic
- The Razor endpoints are determined by the structure of the `Pages` folder
- This is similar to the approach that `WebForms` takes
- A Razor page looks very similar to a Razor view file used in MVC
- A key difference is that each Razor page begins with an `@page` directive
- The `@page` directive makes the file into an MVC action - which means that it
  handles requests directly, without going through a controller

## Razor Pages Initialization

- The initialization of a Razor Pages project is similar to an MVC project
  - The `Program.cs` files are identical
  - The `Startup.cs` files are similar
    - The `ConfigureServices` methods are similar
    - The `Configure` methods are also similar
    - A Razor Pages project doesn't establish a default routing

## PageModel

- The **code behind** file (`.cs`) derives from the `PageModel` class
- The `PageModel` is extended to have properties relevant to the task at hand
- The `PageModel` class typically has two methods: `OnGet` and `OnPost`
- The `OnGet` method prepares the page
- The `OnPost` method handles the form submission
- There are `OnGetAsync` and `OnPostAsync` versions of the methods
- Most of the MVC functions like model binding, validation, and action results
  work the same with `Controllers` and Razor Pages
- Typical `OnPost` flow
- Check the `ModelState`
- If not valid, return the page with any appropriate error message
- If valid, save the data and redirect

## Data Binding

- Razor Pages, by default, bind properties only with **non-GET** verbs
- Binding to properties removes the need to writing code to convert HTTP data to
  the model type
- Binding reduces code by using the same property to render form fields
  (`<input asp-for="Course.CourseName">`) and accept the input
- For security reasons, you must opt in to binding __GET__ request data to page
  model properties
- Verify user input before mapping it to properties
- Opting into __GET__ binding is useful when addressing scenarios that rely on query
  string or route values

## MVVM

- The Razor Pages approach is sometimes known as **MVVM** (Model-View-ViewModel)
- The **Model** is the data
- The **View** is the Razor page
- The **ViewModel** is the fully realized __PageModel__
